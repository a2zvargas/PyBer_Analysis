# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to show the differences in ride-sharing data by city type.  Using this data I'll be able to provide three business ideas to address the disparity among city types.

## Results: 
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
The data shows that rural areas have the least amount of total rides, followed by suburban areas, and finally urban areas having the most amount of total rides.  There is a direct correlation in total number of drivers and total fare revenue.  However, there is an inverse relationship to total rides when we look at the average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  Rides are longer in rural areas and therefore the price per ride is higher and in turn the drivers earn more.

When we look at the first four months of 2019, there is an interesting phenomenon on the third week of February where we see a spike in rides across all three city types, followed by a decline the week after.
