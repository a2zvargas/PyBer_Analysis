# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to show the differences in ride-sharing data by city type.  Using this data I'll be able to provide three business ideas to address the disparity among city types.

## Results: 

The data shows that rural areas have the least amount of total rides, followed by suburban areas, and finally urban areas having the most amount of total rides.  There is a direct correlation in total number of drivers and total fare revenue.  However, there is an inverse relationship to total rides when we look at the average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  Rides are longer in rural areas and therefore the price per ride is higher and in turn the drivers earn more.

When we look at the first four months of 2019, there is an interesting phenomenon on the third week of February where we see a spike in rides across all three city types, followed by a decline the week after.  This is most likely due to people using ride-sharing to get to and from Valentine's Day dates.

We can also see that the first week of April is the busiest time in rural areas in these four months, but it is slow for suburban areas.  Surprisingly the beginning of the year is very slow for all three city types.

## Summary: 

Based on the results, here are three business recommendations for addressing disparities among the city types.
1. The number of drivers in urban areas exceeds the number of rides.  Reducing the number of drivers in urban areas will allow drivers to earn more money and bring them more in line with the other areas.
2. Offer discounts in rural areas to increase the number of rides and in turn increase revenue.
3. Raise fare price in urban areas to increase the average fare per ride and bring it closer to the average fare per ride in suburban areas.
